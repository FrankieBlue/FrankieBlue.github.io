        <h1>Travel to Hogsmeade</h1>
        <h2>About Hogsmeade</h2>
        <p>Hogsmeade is a nice scottish village, located to the north-west of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p>
        <p>Founded more than a thousand years ago by Hengist of Woodcroft, Hogsmeade is known to be the only settlement in Britain inhabited <em>solely</em> by wizards, witches, and other magical beings.</p>
        <p>The village has also played a role in notable historical events, such as the the 1612 rebellion of Britain's goblins.</p>
        <p>Consisting of a main thoroughfare named High Street, Hogsmeade hosts several magical shops and venues for wizards, witches and magical beings from all over Britain.</p>
        <h2>Notable places</h2>
        <p>Should you decide to go and visit Hogsmeade (and you should!), here are some places you may want to go to.</p>
        <h3>Pubs</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Three Broomsticks</strong>.
            <br>Located on High Street, The Three Broomsticks is a well known inn and pub, owned and managed by Madame Rosmerta. Described as being warm, smoky, crowded, and noisy, this pub won't let you feel sad or lonely. Definitely the favourite place of Hogwart's staff and students.<br>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Madame Puddifoot's Teashop</strong>.<br>
                Situated on a little side street, it is a little, steamy place where everything is adorned with bows or frills. The small, circular tables are set for two, and as a matter of fact this teashop is favoured among young couples.<br>
                <em>Curiosity</em>. If you wish to spend some mawkish time with your significant other, try coming to Madame Puddifoot's Teashop on Valentine's day: pink confetti fills the air, thrown by flying golden cherubs!
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Hog's Head</strong>.<br>
                Not exactly the cleanest and welcoming place, The Hog's Head is usually the destination of a more disreputable clientele than the Three Broomsticks, and many of the customers hide their faces out of a desire not to be recognised.<br>However, in the latest century The Hog's Head played a role in numerous important events. Here's some.<br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is in an upper room of this pub that the Seer Sybill Trelawney revealed the <strong class="important_words">prophecy</strong> ragarding He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and Harry Potter to the then headmaster Albus Dumbledore.</li>
                    <li>In this pub <strong class="important_words">Dumbledore's Army</strong> arose: following Hermione Granger's invitation many students gathered to the pub, listening to the words of Granger and Harry Potter. Then the group form, and Ginevra Weasley came up with its name, hinting to the Ministry's fear and obsession.</li>
                    <li>The pub's owner and manager is <strong class="important_words">Albus Dumbledore's brother, Aberforth</strong>, who played an important role during the Battle of Hogwarts, helping members of the Order of the Phoenix and other combatants with getting inside the castle and students with getting out, in addition to fighting himself in the battle.</li>
                    
                </ul><br>
                <em>Curiosity</em>. It was in this pub that the Ministry of Magic settled during the rebellion of Britain's goblins: the upper rooms of the inn served as the headquarter for the Ministry in its attempts to put down the insurrection in the Highlands.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Shops</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Honeydukes</strong>.<br>
                You can't possibly leave Hogsmeade without stopping by Honeydukes: the shop is filled with many different kinds of <em>wonderful and wild sweets</em>, such as Bertie Botts Every Flavoured Beans, Cauldron Cakes, Blood-Flavoured Lollipops, Acid Pops, Droobles Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Wands, Exploding Bonbons, Skeletal Sweets, Jelly Slugs, Cockroach Cluster, and so much more.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Zonko's Joke Shop</strong>.<br>
                Once indepent and considered the best british shop for <em>jokes and tricks</em>, where you could find Dungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap, Nose-Biting Teacups, and much more, this shop has been bought by the Weasly brother's, owners the <em>Weasley Wizard Wheezes</em>, and then enhanced to a new level, full of different types of Weasley products, like Extendable Ears, U-No-Poo, trick wands, Daydream Charms, Edible Dark Marks, Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, Decoy Detonators, love potions, Skiving Snackboxes, and so much more!
            </li>
            <li><strong>Gladrags Wizardwear</strong>.<br>
                Gladrags Wizardwear is a clothing store that was founded in 1750 and run by Gladrags Wizardwear Group Ltd., with branches in London, Paris and Hogsmeade. It is full of quirky merchandise, including socks patterned with flashing gold and silver stars, and socks that scream loudly when they become too smelly. <br>
                Need some new clothes? Give it a try!
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dervish & Banges</strong><br>
                Located near the end of the High Street, Dervish & Banges is a shop that sells and repairs magical equipment.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Notable mention</h3>
        <p>When talking about Hogsmeade, it is impossible to leave out the <strong>Shrieking Shack</strong>.
It is an abandoned house in Hogsmeade, and for many years, villagers thought it was haunted because they often heard screams coming from inside. In fact, the Shrieking Shack was supposed to be <em>the most severely haunted building in Britain</em>, so much so that according to Nearly Headless Nick (Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's ghost), <em>not even the Hogwarts ghosts will enter it</em>.<br>
While the house has remained silent for more than three decades, villagers still prefer to avoid it. Will you dare to venture near it?
